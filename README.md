ParsingAnXML_Document

- XML is similar to JSON, but instead of key/value pairs it uses tags, like HTML.
- The difference between XML and HTML is that the tags use custom names, so every tag is defined by the developer and may represent an specific   value.

Foundation provides the XMLParser class to create an XML parser.
